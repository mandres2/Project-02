##College Choice Data: Open Data Engagement

### Goals:
1. Test out API and data sets with real users to identify any problems with data, documentation, or tech.
2. Build a working feedback loop between the data producers and data users.
3. Make improvements based on the most critical problems.
4. At least 5 products made by external groups are ready to launch by launch day.

### Developer beta, August 3 - launch
Building on the success of similar work by FDA around the release of complex data, this will be an invitation-only group of developers that will have access to the data in draft before the official launch. Participants will be selected carefully from people who 1) have built things with open data, and 2) serve target populations, and all work will be close hold until the public launch of the data. On launch day, selected prototypes built by the developers will be launched in tandem as examples of what is possible.

By working closely with the user groups before launch, the project team will know the highest-value improvements to data and related content.

### Embargoed Access for Data Journalists, 3 days before launch
For three days before the public launch of the data, give embargoed access to data journalists, with the embargo to be lifted at launch. Their stories will have the context provided by experts available to them during the embargo period and allow the team to address any confusion or questions.
