## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to this open source project! If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read LICENSE, and README, all of which are in this repository. If you have any questions, open an [issue](https://github.com/18F/college-choice/issues/new).

## How to contribute copy changes

###Step one
Find the copy you want to change on the site. For example, this copy says "ZIP Code" instead of "ZIP code." The latter is AP style, so I want to edit it.

Then search for that copy in the repository.

The search results will show you where in the code that content actually sits. Click on the file to open it.

###Step two
Click on "Tree:" in the top left corner, and make a new branch that has a descriptive, specific name.

Then, on the top right of the screen, the edit pen will become clickable. Click the pen to start editing.

If there's a lot of code, a tip to find the content you want to edit quickly is, for mac users, to press command and F or for PC users, to press control and F. Then type in the specific copy you're looking for, and make your edit right in the code.

### Step three
To save your edits, scroll down to the bottom of the page, and select "commit directly to the [name you just made] branch." Fill out a short description of your edits in the title, more detail in the body, and commit your changes.

### Step four
Then, go up to the top right of the screen and click the button for pull requests.

Click the "new pull request" button at the top right.

Review your changes to make sure nothing else was modified.
Click on the branch you just created, and then click "create pull request."

A member of the team will now see you've suggested a change and be able to incorporate it, if appropriate.
